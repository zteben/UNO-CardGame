# UNO-CardGame
This project's objective was to recreate the UNO card game into a text-based game using Python. UNO is a shedding-type card game for two to ten players. It is played with its own dedicated deck of 108 cards that contains numbered cards that are classified into four suits—red, yellow, green and blue—and action/wild cards that have a variety of effects.
